🎮 Video Game Sales Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a video game will achieve good or bad global sales based on features such as platform, genre, and publisher.

🧠 Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Statistical analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand sales distribution, detect outliers, and identify patterns between features.

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and removing outliers.

AutoGluon Modeling – Automated model selection to identify the best-performing algorithm.

Feature Engineering – Creation of statistical, interaction, and ranking features to improve accuracy.

Model Evaluation – Best F1-test score of 0.74 achieved using LightGBM.

Manual Retraining – The selected LightGBM model was retrained separately to optimize memory usage.

Deployment – The trained model was integrated into a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
